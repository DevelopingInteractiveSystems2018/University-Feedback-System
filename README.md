# University-Feedback-System
## Overview
University Feedback is online website which provide information about universities, students and study programs to everyone and the main purpose is to help students around the world to choose study program based on their interest and requirements. Mostly, we can easily find information regarding different universities, study programs and scholarships in the internet, we can search and browse these type of information comparatively to help us view and compare the information in a single interface which mostly help students to find study programs, and in some cases students are not happy with their selected study program so they change or maybe drop it, the fact is usually students refer to friends to get their view about considered study program but there is no online and public platform that can provide opportunity for students to give review and share their experiences about their universities and study programs they have been studying and in other hand there is no opportunity for students to know about students review, experiences and understanding about different study programs and universities around the world, most of the students may refer to their friends but if someone want to study abroad then it's a challenge to limit one's self to few reviews of friends, university feedback is online platform which values student's reviews and experiences and provides opportunity to everyone interested to go through the reviews, ratings and experiences of students and searching study programs based on reviews, it can help to easily decide study programs. Users can search and browse information related to universities, study programs, current students, post a question in forum, chat with available mentors and the main point is to be able to search feedbacks from students regarding the study programs and socialize with current students to get further insight about university and overall environment.
